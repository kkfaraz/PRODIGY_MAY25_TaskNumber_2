# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
### Internship PIT/MAY25/10962_Task 2 – Prodigy InfoTech | Machine Learning Track

---

## 📌 Task Description
This project aims to segment retail store customers using **K-Means Clustering** based on their purchase behavior. The dataset includes customer demographics, annual income, and spending score. Through clustering, we identify distinct customer groups to help businesses design better marketing strategies.

---

## 🔍 Understanding & Learning

- Applied **K-Means Clustering** for unsupervised customer segmentation.
- Used **feature scaling**, **elbow method**, and **silhouette score** for model optimization.
- Visualized clusters with **Seaborn** and interpreted customer behaviors.
- Understood real-world use of unsupervised learning in **business intelligence**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Cleaned and analyzed customer data  
✅ Used feature scaling to normalize input space  
✅ Determined optimal clusters using **Elbow Method**  
✅ Validated model with **Silhouette Score**  
✅ Visualized customer groups & saved labeled data  
✅ Professional, modular Python code structure

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Use **PCA** for dimensionality reduction if more features are added.
- Include **Age** and **Gender** to understand deeper demographics.
- Train a **predictive classifier** to identify cluster labels for new customers.
- Deploy the model using **Streamlit** for interactive business use.
